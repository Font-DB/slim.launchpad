# Walters Slim Stack

A Slim Framework scaffolding for rapid development to get up and running in short order.

## Main
This gives you a '/' (root), '/ping' and '/users' path to work with. These routes give you a simple route name.

It also has a NotFoundHandler Controller to handle 404 errors.


### Branches
There will be multiple branches on this tree, each representing a more sophisticated scaffolding structure.


# To Install

Pull down this code, or fork it if you like.

Then run composer update on the composer.json file included.

This scaffolding assumes it will be run at the [sub]domian level:

  ```
  http://my.domain.test
  http://my.domain.test/ping
  http://my.domain.test/users
  ```
